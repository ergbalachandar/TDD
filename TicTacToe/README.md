# TIC-TAC-TOE

   Two players take turns marking an available cell in 3 X 3 Game board with their respective tokens (either "X" or "O"). When one player has placed three tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid, the game is over and that player has won. A draw (no winner) occurs when all the cells on the grid have been filled with tokens and neither player has achieved a win.
   
   ## Purpose:

  This game is developed using Java programming language using TDD (Test Driven Development)
  
   ## Problem Statement/Rules
   
   X always goes first.

   Players cannot play on a played position.

   Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:

        One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally

        All nine squares are filled.

   If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.

   If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
